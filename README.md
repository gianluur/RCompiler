# RCompiler

## Purpose
This the recreation of my old compiler i made in C++, i am recreating it in rust, mainly because i will need some sort of scripting language for my [shell](www.github.com/gianluur/RShell).

## Features
Should be a strongly typed language, without classes or oop, but with some sort of namespaces to properly order your code and to improve usability.

## Syntax

I am thinking currently if recreating the syntax of my old language, currently since we can't even properly parse math expression it will not be discussed.
Update: before writing here the syntax full i want to first finish the tokenizer, once i have a working base i will post the syntax here
